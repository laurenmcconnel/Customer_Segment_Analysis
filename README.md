# Customer_Segment_Analysis
I participated in a group project with five others where we analysed the use of unsupervised learning in customer segmentation. We imported a Dataset from GitHub and cleaned it, used feature engineering and chose an unsupervised learning model to group the data. We chose to use K-Means Clustering to group them based on RFM analysis. We then outlined our findings and the limitations of the model. We used python IDE for our analysis.
The members of my group were: Cian Murray-Doyle, Daniel Heather, Jeff Bowers and Dami Darimola
